<p>There's not much I have to say about web design that you won't learn from the fine authors mentioned in the <a href="/site/">Site Notes</a> section.  But I do have some nifty javascript to share.</p>
<p>This <a href="matrix_5_000.html">Binary Matrix Animation</a> presents a table initially containing all 0s.  Clicking on the table toggles an animation state, where "blips" will travel at varying speeds through the table.  The above link works in a black background.  There's also one designed for a <a href="matrix_5_fff.html">white background</a> although its color scheme could still use some fine tuning.  I haven't done extensive testing, but verified that they work in both IE6/Win and Mozilla 1.6/Win.  Fortunately, everything is available in the source of those two pages and you are more than welcome to use and modify.  Enjoy!
